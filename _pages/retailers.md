14Oct5:52p I am excited about research which advances the perception and control of mobile robotics.
In particular, I am currently working on leveraging geometry for unsupervised learning, reasoning under uncertainty with Bayesian deep learning and developing end-to-end systems which can reason from perception to control. 
My research has been used to power smart-city infrastructure with [Vivacity](http://www.vivacitylabs.com/), control self-driving cars with [Toyota Research Institute](http://www.tri.global/) and enable next-generation drone flight with [Skydio](https://www.skydio.com/).

# Scene Understanding

Scene understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision which requires understanding the scene's geometry and semantic structure.
Initially, I worked on a semantic segmentation algorithm called [SegNet](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/segnet/).
More recently, I have been interested in learning depth, instance and semantic segmentation from a [unified deep learning architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.07115.pdf).
